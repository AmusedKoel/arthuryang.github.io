# Welcome and Hello World!

## About me

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a freshman majoring in Communications and New Media. I have no prior programming experience and this course, `NM2207`,has introduced me to the **R programming** language. This is also my first time creating a website!

The learning curve for this course is steep but I have been enjoying the rigour thus far. If things goes well, I plan to take up a minor in **Interactive Media Design**. I don't know if I have the strength to battle NUS's infamous `CS1010`, but it is definitely worth a challenge!

## My interests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I love **travelling** and experiencing different cultures. I have had many **great memories** of different places and I feel that travelling helps to grow a **sense of empathy** for the world around. My plan is to fit in a short vacation every semester break. Maybe I should create a website documenting my travel adventures!

## Why did I take up NM2207?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an aspiring digital marketer, I believe the skills I learn about **data analysis, visualisation and web development** will be very useful in my future internships. Marketers deal with data and we aim to **extract insights** to hit our objectives. Visualisations help us to identify these insights, and make the less obvious more clear.
