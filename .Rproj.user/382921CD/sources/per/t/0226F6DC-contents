## What is my project about?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will explore Airbnb pricing using **spatial econometrics**. My primary goal is to understand how locations of Airbnbs affect pricing. I will also investigate the impact of neighbourhood attractiveness, as measured by attraction indices, on pricing strategies. By employing spatial econometrics, this project will account for the inherent spatial dependence often present in location-based data like Airbnb rentals. This allows for a more robust and nuanced understanding of the price drivers behind Airbnb pricing across cities and neighbourhoods.

As an avid traveller myself, the insights drawn can help give me a better understanding of how location and neighbourhood appeal influence pricing.

## What questions will I answer?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   How do the determinants of Airbnb prices differ between cities?

-   What is the impact of neighborhood attractiveness (as measured by the attraction indices) on pricing?

-   Are there significant differences between weekday and weekend pricing strategies?

## What dataset am I working with?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be using a dataset which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains multiple csv files recording the price, location, and TripAdvisor ratings of different Airbnb rentals across multiple European cities.

You can access the dataset through the link below.
